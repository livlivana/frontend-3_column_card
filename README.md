## My process


### What I learned

For this challenge, I got more comfortable and confident in re-adjusting the divs and containers with the property-value of auto (rather than trying to manually write down a fixed size for the card height/width).

In addition, I am starting to enjoy building a responsive web design (to fit to different screen sizes). I get to play around with the different styling properties and think of new ways to display the web elements while ensuring quality user experience.  


### Continued development

For my next few challenges, I want to practice more responsive web designs while taking on more complicated layouts. I hope doing so will allow me to get more familiar with the different styling properties. 
Additionally, I think it will be good for me to explore other display types like grid and block.
